description: <center><img src="img/portfolio/evolution_preview.gif" width="100%" height="100%"></center><p>I created a round based natural selection simulator.</p><p>In each round, n herbivores are spawned in the center of the screen, and m carnivores are spawned a configurable distance away from the center. Vegetables will be spawned outside of the center. Carnivores will try to eat the herbivores and herbivores will try to eat vegetables. A round ends once all vegetables are eaten. If a creature eats enough food, they will produce offspring for the next round and pass on their traits. The traits of their offspring will be randomly mutated based on the parent's values. Traits include speed, size, and sight distance.</p><p>After the end of each simulation, a log is created. The github repository contains <a href="https://github.com/justinctse/EvolutionSim/blob/master/analysis/example_1.ipynb">examples</a> and functions to use to analyze a run.</p><center><img src="img/portfolio/analysis_screenshot.png" width="80%" height="80%"><p><i>A graph depicting how average velocity changes throughout the rounds.</i></img></p>
