description: <p>This analysis was done for an AI project competition hosted by the Columbia Statistics Club. My group of 3 received third place. We used the <a href = "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/">Speed Dating Data Set</a> compiled by the Columbia Business School in 2002-2004. Each observation in the dataset represents a speed date that a single person went on. Demographic information, interests, and subjective qualities about each person are recorded. After data cleaning, we transformed the entire dataset so that each observation represented a date between two participants.</p><p>The models used were Random Forests, Linear SVMs, and Neural Networks. The main challenge in the modeling was that it was difficult to get a high true positive rate.</p> <h3>Key Takeaways</h3><br><ul><li><p>For most participants, their perception of their date's attractiveness was the most important variable in determining if that person wanted to go on another date. </p></li> <li><p>Participants' perceptions about their own qualities like attractiveness and intelligence were only loosely correlated with what their date thought about those qualities. </p></li></ul>
