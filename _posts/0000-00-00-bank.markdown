description: This was an independent project based on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/data">data</a> provided by Santander bank. The dataset consisted of demographic and transactional behavior of customers over a 17-month period. I used this data to predict which products customers would buy in a certain timeframe and also to create a measure for customer satisfaction. <p>The models used were association rule learning, logistic regression, random forests, gradient tree boosting, and neural networks. The main challenge of this project was coming up with ways to deal with heavily imbalanced classes (<1%). Class rebalancing via over-sampling or under-sampling proved to be an efficent way to improve results.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><br><ul><li><p>Demographic data is important when gauging customer satisfaction but it is not useful when predicting which products a customer will buy.</p></li><li><p>It is much easier to predict if a customer will drop an item than it is to predict when they will buy a new item.</p></li><li><p>When predicting customer satisfaction and identifying which customers would leave the bank, I was able to create 4 new features that gave strong indications for at risk customers.</p></li></ul>
